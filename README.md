# Welcome to PiChat

Latest changes:
- tried to make a prototype icon for the app and set this icon as the apps icon
- removed scroll bar (u can still scroll)
- made custom css title bar, centered text, icon next to this text
- custom window control buttons (fade in color when hovered, hover color fills entire area)

Idea: I want the opening page to be an onboard like log in / sign up but idk if we are supposed 
to start with that first

- the log in sign up brings u to A placeholder log in

ISSUES:
- The buttons dont redirect to sites (prob bc it was made to be withkn a browser already)
